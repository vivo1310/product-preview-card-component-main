## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- The image at the left side cover the border of the card, the solution is to use `overflow` attribute
```css
overflow: hidden
```


### Continued development

- For future development, I might use Grid instead of Flexbox.
